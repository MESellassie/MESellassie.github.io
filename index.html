            <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my profile. I am a burgeoning web developer with over seven years
                experience in
                front-end Word Press and .Net management. I am currently pursuing certification for front-end and
                back-end web development through Georgia Tech's Coding Bootcamp to expand my understanding of
                development and to obtain the skills I'll need to pass this knowledge on to the next generation.</p>
            <p>Education is the primary tool for social mobility in our country. Yet, those most in need of social
                mobility are often left on the fringes of quality educational attainment due in large part to outdated
                systems and a severe lack of exposure to life-transforming fields like coding. My goal is to use this
                knowledge to teach students from underserved communities and provide them the bridge necessary to enter
                the promising field of coding.</p>
            <p>Currently, I work with the Southern Education Foundation to research, design and implement academic
                projects that promote education equity in the South.</p>
